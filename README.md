# domain-learning in PDDL

This is the Python code for a program that reads a list of actions, their preconditions and postconditions and derives a classic PDDL domain from it.

Further details can be found in the included [paper.pdf](https://github.com/stchepanhagn/domain-learning/blob/master/paper.pdf).

### To-do

- Write an iterator to read a batch of examples and test the generated domain. If the domain passes, stop training. Otherwise, read more examples.
